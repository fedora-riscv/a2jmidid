-A single, static, one-way bridge from legacy ALSA MIDI to JACK MIDI.  Mostly useful for those needing a steady bridge rather than an active briding daemon such as a2jmidid.  Multiple instances of this can be run simultaneously.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 a2jmidid is a daemon that implements automatic bridging. For every ALSA
-sequencer port you get one jack midi port. If ALSA sequencer port is
+sequencer port you get one JACK midi port. If ALSA sequencer port is
 both input and output one, you get two JACK MIDI ports, one input and
 output.
