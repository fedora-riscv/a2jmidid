 .SH NOTES
 ALSA does not guarantee client names to by unique. I.e. it is possible
 to have two apps that create two clients with same ALSA client name.
-JACK however requires port names to be unqiue. To ensure this uniqueness,
+JACK however requires port names to be unique. To ensure this uniqueness,
 a2jmidid will add the unique numeric ALSA client ID to the JACK port name.
 However this behaviour is known to be problematic when restoring
 connections using simplistic tools like aj\-snapshot and jack_connect.
 In order to make them work, the -u option can be used. This option will
 cause a2jmidid to omit the numeric ALSA Client ID from JACK port names.
-In this mode, ALSA client name uniqueness must be guartanteed externally.
